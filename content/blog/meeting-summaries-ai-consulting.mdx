## The problem

Automated transcription and summaries cut note‑taking time by 75% and improved handoff quality across a boutique consulting firm.

## The AI solution

Consultants juggle delivery and documentation. A boutique firm adopted AI transcription and summary tools to speed up client notes and reduce errors.

Transcripts fed structured recaps, action lists, and risks into the team’s project tool. Consultants reviewed and edited, then shared with clients post‑meeting.

Result: hours saved weekly and fewer dropped balls. See examples in the source compilation.

SMB takeaway: start with a single team, add a template library, and measure prep time and client satisfaction.
