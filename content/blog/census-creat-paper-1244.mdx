**TL;DR**

- Data profile relevant to labor, technology, and productivity patterns.
- Useful context for SMBs evaluating AI skills, hiring, and upskilling.
- Align tech adoption with workforce planning and role design.

## 📊 Highlights

- Aggregates research insights intersecting tech adoption and labor outcomes—useful context for small firms planning AI roles.
- Signals that task composition is shifting; “digital dexterity” and prompt literacy become differentiators.
- Data can inform hiring, training, and internal mobility decisions during AI rollouts.
- Useful for mapping career paths and reskilling plans as workflows change.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A small logistics company documented the tasks most impacted by AI (drafting notices, report prep, FAQ responses) and created micro‑trainings. Within a quarter, staff shifted hours from manual prep to exception handling and customer follow‑ups. Managers used the profile data to justify role redesign and a modest bonus tied to on‑time completion of the new workflow.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Map roles to tasks; note which tasks are candidates for AI assistance and which require human judgment.
- Create a 4–6 week upskilling plan focused on prompts, QA, and handoff quality.
- Track outcomes like time saved, error rates, and customer satisfaction.
- Add a quarterly review of job descriptions and pay ladders to reflect new skills and responsibilities.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- Clear role‑task mapping reduces confusion and resistance during adoption.
- Focused upskilling improves throughput and service levels without increasing headcount.
- KPI tracking clarifies ROI and informs future hiring decisions.
- Look for rising throughput per employee and higher first‑contact resolution as signs the transition is working.
