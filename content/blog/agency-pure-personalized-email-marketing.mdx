## The problem

Agency Pure used AI to build personalized newsletters, increasing open and click rates while reducing time spent on curation.

## The AI solution

Agencies benefit from content curation at scale. Agency Pure leveraged AI to tailor newsletters to individual interests, improving relevance and performance.

The system selected articles based on engagement signals and topics, drafting personalized intros that editors reviewed before sending.

SMB takeaway: start with a single segment and a weekly cadence. Track open rate and click‑through versus your baseline.
