## The problem

Jackie’s Jams used generative AI helpers to draft social posts and product copy, saving roughly an hour per day across the small team.

## The AI solution

Small batch food producers need consistent content without big teams. The owners adopted AI tools to brainstorm ideas, draft captions, and create product descriptions; humans edited for tone and authenticity.

SMB takeaway: set aside a weekly “AI hour” to outline, draft, and schedule posts. Track time saved and engagement versus your baseline.
