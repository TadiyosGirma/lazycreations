Personalization isn&apos;t just for big players. A small retailer implemented AI‑driven product recommendations and segmented offers based on browsing, purchase history, and seasonality.

Tools included recommendation services and simple rules to feature relevant bundles. The team A/B tested placements and tuned content weekly.

Impact: around a 30% sales increase attributed to better targeting and discovery.
