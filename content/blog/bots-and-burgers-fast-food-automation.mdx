## The problem

A fast‑food business used AI ordering and kitchen support to cut wait times and improve service consistency.

## The AI solution

Small restaurants face thin margins and staffing gaps. A quick‑service chain piloted AI for drive‑thru ordering and kitchen assistance, aiming to reduce wait times while keeping accuracy high.

Voice assistants handled routine orders, while kitchen screens suggested prep sequencing based on demand. The result: faster service and more consistent output, especially during peaks.

SMB takeaway: start with one station (ordering or kitchen expo). Measure order accuracy, average ticket time, and upsell rate before wider rollout.

- Blend heuristics with ML for quicker wins and safer rollout
- Train staff and bake new steps into SOPs to lock in gains
