## The problem

A small business owner used AI to track tariff and inflation news, informing pricing and purchasing decisions without hiring analysts.

## The AI solution

Volatile tariffs and prices pressure SMB margins. One founder built a lightweight AI workflow to summarize market news, supplier updates, and policy changes.

Each morning, a digest highlighted key changes and suggested actions (adjust PO timing, review pricing tiers). The owner reviewed signals weekly with the team.

Outcome: fewer surprises and more proactive pricing and purchasing.

SMB takeaway: automate “morning brief” prep. Track gross margin and stockout incidents during pilots.
