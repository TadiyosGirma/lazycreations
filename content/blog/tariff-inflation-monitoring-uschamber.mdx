Volatile tariffs and prices pressure SMB margins. One founder built a lightweight AI workflow to summarize market news, supplier updates, and policy changes.

Each morning, a digest highlighted key changes and suggested actions (adjust PO timing, review pricing tiers). The owner reviewed signals weekly with the team.

Outcome: fewer surprises and more proactive pricing and purchasing.
