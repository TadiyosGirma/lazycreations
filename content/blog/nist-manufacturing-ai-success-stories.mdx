**TL;DR**

- AI delivers measurable gains in quality and throughput.
- Use cases: defect detection, predictive maintenance, process optimization.
- Start with targeted pilots and quality metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Summarizes implemented AI projects improving quality inspection, maintenance, and process optimization.
- Demonstrates that targeted pilots with quality metrics produce tangible results.

## ðŸ—£ Case study anecdote

A packaging line added AIâ€‘assisted vision to flag defects earlier. Scrap dropped and firstâ€‘pass yield improved as rootâ€‘cause reviews became weekly practice.

## ðŸ›  Guidance for SMBs

- Focus pilots on one bottleneck; measure scrap rate, downtime, and yield.
- Start with offâ€‘theâ€‘shelf models and a manual verification loop; automate as confidence grows.
- Share dashboards on the shop floor to keep teams engaged and responsive.

## ðŸ“ˆ Lessons & metrics

- Firstâ€‘pass yield, scrap, and downtime are the northâ€‘star metrics.
- Visual management of quality trends accelerates improvement cycles.
