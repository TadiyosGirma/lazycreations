**TL;DR**

- AI delivers measurable gains in quality and throughput.
- Use cases: defect detection, predictive maintenance, process optimization.
- Start with targeted pilots and quality metrics.

## 📊 Highlights

- Summarizes implemented AI projects improving quality inspection, maintenance, and process optimization.
- Demonstrates that targeted pilots with quality metrics produce tangible results.
- Emphasizes human‑in‑the‑loop verification early on to build trust with operators.
- Encourages visual dashboards on the shop floor to shorten response cycles.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A packaging line added AI‑assisted vision to flag defects earlier. Scrap dropped and first‑pass yield improved as root‑cause reviews became weekly practice. By pairing alerts with a “stop‑to‑fix” routine and shift handoff notes, teams shared learnings and reduced repeat issues week over week.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Focus pilots on one bottleneck; measure scrap rate, downtime, and yield.
- Start with off‑the‑shelf models and a manual verification loop; automate as confidence grows.
- Share dashboards on the shop floor to keep teams engaged and responsive.
- Train operators on prompt/annotation basics so feedback improves models faster.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- First‑pass yield, scrap, and downtime are the north‑star metrics.
- Visual management of quality trends accelerates improvement cycles.
- Alarm precision/recall improves with labeled examples; track it as a leading indicator.
