## The problem

ad‑flex communications used AI to reduce cost per result by 81% and boost conversions by 439% through optimized creatives and targeting.

## The AI solution

Performance agencies must iterate fast. ad‑flex communications applied AI to generate creative variants, refine audiences, and reallocate budget based on predicted lift.

The approach increased signal volume for learning and reduced wasted spend, producing dramatic efficiency gains in their campaign case study.

SMB takeaway: pair AI creative generation with rigorous testing. Track CPA, ROAS, and conversion rate week over week.
