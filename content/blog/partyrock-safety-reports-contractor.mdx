## The problem

A small food brand needed to digest complex scientific papers quickly and produce plain‑English summaries for customers and partners.

## The AI solution

Using AWS PartyRock, the team set up prompts that extract key findings, risks, and recommendations from PDFs. Drafts became product content and FAQs.

SMB takeaway: pick one repetitive content type. Use AI to draft, then human‑edit for accuracy and tone.
