Time is the scarcest resource for solo founders. One entrepreneur adopted AI to summarize research, extract insights, and draft campaign concepts—freeing up hours for delivery.

Workflows included queryable research briefs, email draft generation, and idea scoring. The human edited for voice and accuracy before sending.

Outcome: faster go‑to‑market cycles and more consistent outreach cadence.
