GetTransfer, a travel and ride marketplace, needed to reduce dispatch costs and improve ETA accuracy as demand scaled. For SMBs in transport and logistics, poor matching and routing quickly erode margins and CSAT.

The team developed an in‑house AI system to match riders with drivers and optimize pricing and routing. Signals included historical demand, driver proximity, traffic, and seasonality. Tooling combined predictive models and operational heuristics, with experimentation guided by product analytics.

Impact: lower per‑ride costs and better customer experience thanks to improved matching and more reliable ETAs. See the original write‑up for details and context.

Takeaway for SMBs: you do not need a research lab—start with the data you already have (orders, routes, demand patterns) and layer pragmatic prediction. Pilot in one city, measure cost per job and on‑time rates, then scale.
