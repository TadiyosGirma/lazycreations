## The problem

Peace Love & Happiness Club used AI to cut back‑office time, freeing a full day a week for growth initiatives and customer care.

## The AI solution

Peace Love & Happiness Club, a boutique plant shop, grappled with time‑consuming admin work—inventory notes, product copy, and routine messages. For SMB retailers, these tasks sap time from merchandising and service.

They adopted pragmatic AI helpers to draft descriptions, summarize vendor updates, and prep customer messages. Staff reviewed for accuracy and tone.

Outcome: back‑office work shrank markedly—about a day a week reclaimed to focus on growth and customers.

SMB takeaway: list your five most repetitive back‑office tasks. Automate drafts first, keep humans in the loop.
