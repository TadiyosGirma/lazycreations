Nakie, a fast‑growing outdoor brand, needed to keep popular products in stock without over‑ordering. Manual forecasting struggled during peaks.

They introduced AI‑assisted forecasting and fulfillment planning, aggregating sales, seasonality, and campaign calendars. The team reviewed suggestions weekly and adjusted purchase orders.

Impact: fewer stockouts and faster fulfillment with the same staff. Read the coverage for more detail.
