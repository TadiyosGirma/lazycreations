## The problem

Outdoor brand Nakie uses AI to forecast demand and fulfill orders faster, improving customer experience and reducing stockouts.

## The AI solution

Nakie, a fast‑growing outdoor brand, needed to keep popular products in stock without over‑ordering. Manual forecasting struggled during peaks.

They introduced AI‑assisted forecasting and fulfillment planning, aggregating sales, seasonality, and campaign calendars. The team reviewed suggestions weekly and adjusted purchase orders.

Impact: fewer stockouts and faster fulfillment with the same staff. Read the coverage for more detail.

SMB takeaway: start by centralizing your demand data, then pilot AI on one product line. Measure stockout rate and delivery times.
