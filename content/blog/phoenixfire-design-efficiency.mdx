PhoenixFire Design, a boutique studio, wanted to accelerate design cycles without compromising quality. Like many SMB creative teams, admin and repetitive tasks consumed billable hours.

They introduced AI helpers for moodboards, outline generation, draft variations, and image exploration. Tools included ChatGPT for briefs, image models for concept exploration, and automation to assemble deliverables.

Outcome: a meaningful “efficiency bump” that let the team ship faster and focus on high‑value creative work. Read the original note for context.

SMB takeaway: target the 20% of tasks that slow you down—briefing, first drafts, handoffs. Time‑box experiments, document wins, then standardize the workflow.
