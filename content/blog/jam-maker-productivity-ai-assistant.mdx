## The problem

A small food producer used AI to draft content and summarize ops notes, saving an hour a day and reducing context switching.

## The AI solution

For small batch food producers, every hour matters. A jam maker adopted AI assistants to outline content, draft emails, and summarize production notes.

With tools like ChatGPT, they reduced admin overhead and kept customers informed without burning evenings. The steady cadence improved engagement and freed time for production.

SMB takeaway: define a weekly “AI hour” for drafts and summaries. Edit for tone, then schedule.
