## The problem

A volunteer network built PartyRock apps to match fosters faster and draft better outreach, multiplying impact without extra staff.

## The AI solution

A small nonprofit coordinating an “army” of fosters and volunteers needed to triage inquiries and draft outreach quickly. Manual work slowed down placements.

Using AWS PartyRock, they spun up lightweight apps to summarize requests, suggest next steps, and standardize messages. Volunteers worked faster with fewer mistakes.
