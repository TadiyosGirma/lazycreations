## The problem

Kim Cook used AI to draft product copy and optimize ads, helping a small retailer grow faster without added headcount.

## The AI solution

Independent retailers juggle merchandising and marketing. Boutique owner Kim Cook adopted AI to speed up product descriptions, image variations, and ad copy tests.

Using lightweight tools, the team shipped more campaigns with better targeting, improving reach and conversions while keeping the brand’s voice intact through human review.

Outcome: faster marketing cycles and continued growth thanks in part to AI assistance.

SMB takeaway: establish a weekly content cadence. Use AI for drafts and variants; keep humans on brand and compliance.
