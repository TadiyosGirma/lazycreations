**TL;DR**

- AI supports lean practices with better detection and forecasting.
- Metrics improve through targeted pilots.
- Start with one line or cell and measure.

## 📊 Highlights

- Shares examples of AI improving lean outcomes in smaller plants.
- Focus on bottleneck identification, early defect detection, and predictive signals.
- Combines classic lean practices (visual management, SMED, kaizen) with modern sensing and anomaly detection.
- Low‑cost sensors and edge models make pilots feasible without large capital projects.
- Data captured during kaizen cycles becomes training material that improves models over time.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A family‑owned shop used AI to forecast changeovers and detect quality drift. The result: fewer interruptions, lower scrap, and smoother throughput. Operators received clear alerts on a line display with suggested checks (fixture, temperature, feed). Shift handoffs included a short “what changed” note so the next crew could continue improvements rather than start from zero.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Track OEE, scrap, and changeover time. Visualize trends on the floor.
- Start with one cell; add manual verification before automating actions.
- Run weekly kaizen reviews to lock in gains.
- Standardize label/defect categories so operators can tag examples consistently; use these examples to retrain models monthly.
- Add a simple SOP for responding to alerts (pause → verify → correct → record), and keep spare parts/tools near the line for faster interventions.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- Lean and AI complement each other: detect earlier, fix faster.
- Small, sustained changes compound into meaningful throughput gains.
- Watch first‑pass yield, scrap per thousand units, changeover minutes, and time‑to‑intervention to quantify progress.
