**TL;DR**

- AI supports lean practices with better detection and forecasting.
- Metrics improve through targeted pilots.
- Start with one line or cell and measure.

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Shares examples of AI improving lean outcomes in smaller plants.
- Focus on bottleneck identification, early defect detection, and predictive signals.

## ðŸ—£ Case study anecdote

A familyâ€‘owned shop used AI to forecast changeovers and detect quality drift. The result: fewer interruptions, lower scrap, and smoother throughput.

## ðŸ›  Guidance for SMBs

- Track OEE, scrap, and changeover time. Visualize trends on the floor.
- Start with one cell; add manual verification before automating actions.
- Run weekly kaizen reviews to lock in gains.

## ðŸ“ˆ Lessons & metrics

- Lean and AI complement each other: detect earlier, fix faster.
- Small, sustained changes compound into meaningful throughput gains.
