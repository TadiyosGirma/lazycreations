Deliveries make or break customer experience for food SMBs. A local bakery adopted AI‑assisted route planning to optimize daily drops.

The model considered traffic, delivery windows, and order clustering to propose efficient routes. Staff tweaked plans as needed and tracked actuals to improve suggestions.

Impact: up to 20% faster deliveries and lower fuel costs. See background coverage for examples.
