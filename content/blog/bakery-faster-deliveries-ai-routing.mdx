## The problem

A bakery used AI‑assisted routing to deliver up to 20% faster and cut fuel costs during peak seasons.

## The AI solution

Deliveries make or break customer experience for food SMBs. A local bakery adopted AI‑assisted route planning to optimize daily drops.

The model considered traffic, delivery windows, and order clustering to propose efficient routes. Staff tweaked plans as needed and tracked actuals to improve suggestions.

Impact: up to 20% faster deliveries and lower fuel costs. See background coverage for examples.

SMB takeaway: start by exporting delivery history, then test AI routing on one day a week. Measure on‑time rate and miles driven.
