## The problem

Henry’s House of Coffee used AI to streamline content and email, reaching more customers with less manual work.

## The AI solution

Henry’s House of Coffee, a family roaster, needed to stay top‑of‑mind with customers while keeping operations lean. Like many SMBs, content and email took time they didn’t have.

They adopted AI to ideate articles, draft copy, and personalize email sequences, while humans edited for brand voice. The result: more frequent, relevant touchpoints and steady growth.

SMB takeaway: automate the first draft, not the final voice. Track open rate, click‑through, and repeat purchase rate.
