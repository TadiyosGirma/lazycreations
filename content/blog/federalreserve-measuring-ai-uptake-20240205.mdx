**TL;DR**

- Measurement frameworks are essential to understand AI adoption and impact.
- Indicators include usage intensity, task coverage, and outcome measures.
- SMBs should tie usage metrics to business KPIs to validate ROI.

## 📊 Highlights

- Surveys approaches to quantifying AI uptake in workplaces and the limits of pure “usage” metrics.
- Emphasizes pairing usage indicators with outcomes (cycle time, error rate, revenue impact) to avoid vanity measures.
- Provides a foundation to design lightweight measurement plans in SMBs.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A boutique agency tracked AI‑assisted drafts per week, edit time, and campaign results. Over a month, draft throughput rose while edit time fell; CPA improved as testing velocity increased.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Combine two metric sets: (1) usage (assisted outputs, tasks covered), and (2) outcomes (response time, conversion, error rate).
- Build a one‑page measurement plan; report results weekly. Adjust prompts/SOPs where outcomes lag.
- Avoid over‑instrumentation—keep it simple and comparable week to week.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- Usage without outcomes is misleading; link activity to impact.
- Lightweight measurement sustains momentum and clarifies where to invest next.
