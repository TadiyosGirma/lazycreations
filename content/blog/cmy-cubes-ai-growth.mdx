## The problem

CMY Cubes embraced AI across content and operations, freeing the team for higher‑value work and fueling growth.

## The AI solution

As demand rose, CMY Cubes used AI to assist with content, customer service, and behind‑the‑scenes ops. Like many SMBs, the goal was to do more with the same headcount.

AI tools drafted product copy, summarized support threads, and helped plan social posts. The team edited for brand voice and oversaw quality.

SMB takeaway: pick two workflows (content and support) and write a simple playbook. Track hours saved and CSAT.
