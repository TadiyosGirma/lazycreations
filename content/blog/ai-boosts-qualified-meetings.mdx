## The problem

A professional services firm used AI scoring and routing to prioritize leads, boosting qualified meetings by 40%.

## The AI solution

Services firms live or die by pipeline quality. One firm used AI‑assisted scoring and routing to focus on the best leads.

Signals like company size, urgency, and budget informed scoring. High‑value leads triggered faster outreach and senior assignment; others were nurtured.

Outcome: 40% more qualified meetings with fewer touches. See the reference article for more examples and metrics.

SMB takeaway: connect your form to a simple scorer first. Measure time‑to‑first‑reply and meeting rate.
