Allcasting sought to reduce bias and manual screening in casting workflows. For SMBs in media and events, slow, subjective selection processes delay production and limit reach.

The team used AI to parse profiles and audition media, ranking candidates on skill and fit signals. Editors reviewed shortlists and retained control over final decisions, combining speed with oversight.

Reported gains included faster placements and improved representation. See the coverage for examples and approach.

For SMBs: start with assisted ranking, not full automation. Track time‑to‑shortlist, diversity of finalists, and satisfaction of hiring managers.
