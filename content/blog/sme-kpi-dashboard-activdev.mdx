## The problem

A small enterprise centralized metrics with an AI‑assisted dashboard, improving decisions and reducing report prep time.

## The AI solution

Leaders need a clear view of pipeline, revenue, and service levels. One SME built an AI‑assisted dashboard to consolidate CRM, finance, and support data into daily insights.

Natural‑language queries surfaced trends, while automated digests summarized changes. Team leads reviewed anomalies and acted faster.

Impact: less time building reports, more time steering the business. See similar examples and architecture notes in the source compilation.

SMB takeaway: start by listing 5 weekly questions you ask. Build a single dashboard to answer them and send an automated Friday recap.
