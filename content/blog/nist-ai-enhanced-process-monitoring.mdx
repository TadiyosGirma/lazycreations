**TL;DR**

- AI improves detection, prediction, and responsiveness in manufacturing.
- Pilot on one process and track quality metrics.
- Scale after validated gains.

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Discusses approaches and benefits of AIâ€‘enhanced process monitoring.
- Shows how earlier detection and predictive alerts reduce waste and downtime.

## ðŸ—£ Case study anecdote

A food manufacturer added anomaly detection to its packaging line. Operators received early alerts and adjusted settings before defects cascaded, improving uptime.

## ðŸ›  Guidance for SMBs

- Start with a monitoring MVP and measure false positives, scrap, and downtime.
- Keep humansâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop initially; automate only after alarm precision is proven.
- Publish a small dashboard of quality/uptime signals to align shifts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Lessons & metrics

- Precision and recall for alerts, scrap rate, and downtime are the core metrics.
- Visualizing trends helps operators intervene faster.
