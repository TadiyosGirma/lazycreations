Many SMBs miss out on leads that arrive after hours. One SME used AI chat to resolve FAQs, route complex issues, and collect buying signals for sales.

The assistant integrated with the helpdesk and CRM, creating tickets, updating contact attributes, and triggering nurtures. Humans remained in the loop for edge cases.

Impact: more qualified conversations and faster first response. Related outcomes: up to 40% more qualified meetings in similar rollouts.

Takeaway: start with a constrained FAQ + lead capture scope. Measure time‑to‑first‑reply and qualified meeting rate.
