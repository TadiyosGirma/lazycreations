## The problem

A small business used AI to prioritize outreach and tailor offers, improving customer acquisition and retention metrics without extra headcount.

## The AI solution

Customer acquisition is expensive; retention pays the bills. One SMB layered AI on top of its CRM to score leads, personalize offers, and trigger timely follow‑ups.

Signals from web, email, and purchase history drove segment‑specific nurtures. Sales focused on hot accounts while marketing automated long‑tail education.

Outcome: steadier pipeline and higher repeat purchase rate. See the U.S. Chamber overview for examples of similar wins.

SMB takeaway: start with simple lead scoring and two nurtures (hot vs. warm). Track time‑to‑first‑reply and 60‑day retention.
