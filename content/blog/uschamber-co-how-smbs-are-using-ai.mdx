**TL;DR**

- Common uses: content, customer service, analytics.
- Gains: speed, consistency, better targeting.
- Begin with a constrained pilot and KPIs.

## 📊 Highlights

- Overview of common use cases and simple starting points for small firms.
- Time savings and consistency emerge when prompts and SOPs are documented.
- Adoption works best with weekly cadence, owners, and simple QA.
- Risks (privacy, hallucination) are mitigated with guardrails and human‑in‑the‑loop.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A legal services micro‑firm adopted AI for intake triage and weekly content briefs. The principal reported steadier inbound and less after‑hours admin. With a shared prompt sheet and a response‑time KPI, the team saw faster replies and better qualification on discovery calls.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Institute a weekly “AI hour,” maintain a prompt library, and track KPIs.
- Use a simple two‑step QA to ensure tone and accuracy.
- Publish a dashboard for first‑response, content cadence, and edit time. Review wins/learnings weekly.
- Start with internal drafts and reporting before automating customer‑facing steps.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- Intake response time, meeting rates, and content cadence are the first dials to watch. Edit time and rework should fall as prompts mature.
