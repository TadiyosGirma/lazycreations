## The problem

Local restaurants live and die by repeat visits and word of mouth. La Belle Eatery, a neighborhood cafe, was posting on social and sending occasional emails—but decisions were driven by gut feel. The team lacked visibility into which menu items and offers resonated with specific audiences (weekday commuters vs. weekend families) and which channels actually produced paying customers. Marketing felt random, and the owner wanted a simple, data‑driven way to bring more people in the door without ballooning costs or workload.

## The AI solution

La Belle adopted an AI‑assisted local‑marketing workflow centered on first‑party data and lightweight automation:

- Consolidated customer touchpoints (email sign‑ups, online orders, loyalty redemptions) so the same person wasn’t treated as three different “contacts.”
- Used AI to analyze historical purchase patterns and seasonal trends, clustering customers into segments such as “weekday lunch regulars,” “coffee‑and‑pastry commuters,” and “weekend brunch families.”
- Generated promotion ideas personalized to each segment (e.g., a commuter bundle before 10 a.m., kids‑eat‑free add‑ons for weekend families) and drafted on‑brand copy for email, SMS, and social in seconds.
- Scheduled tests and measured lift across simple KPIs: new first‑time purchasers per week, repeat visit rate, and average ticket size.

Critically, the team kept humans in the loop: staff reviewed drafts for tone and accuracy, and they capped frequency to avoid over‑messaging. The output was a steady cadence of timely, relevant offers without extra headcount.

## Results & metrics

- New customer acquisition increased by roughly 20% after shifting to data‑informed campaigns and clearer segment targeting.
- Repeat visit rate improved as promotions aligned with each customer’s habits (e.g., breakfast‑oriented offers for morning regulars, family bundles on weekends).
- Content production time dropped from hours to minutes per campaign; managers spent time on menu and service quality rather than copywriting.

These results mirror broader small‑business outcomes reported for AI‑assisted marketing: faster campaign velocity, better targeting, and measurable lift in new and returning customers.

## Lessons for SMBs

- Start with the data you already have: order history, loyalty, or email sign‑ups. Clean identities matter more than fancy models.
- Define 2–3 audience segments and one simple KPI per segment (first‑time orders, repeat rate). Use AI to draft offers and copy; keep humans on brand and compliance.
- Run short tests and review weekly. Turn wins into reusable campaigns and retire the rest.
