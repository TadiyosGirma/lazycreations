**TL;DR**

- Identify needs, evaluate tools, train teams, manage risk.
- Focus on measurable use cases and customer benefit.
- Start small and scale what works.

## 📊 Highlights

- Official SBA guidance emphasizes practical, responsible adoption for small businesses.
- Key themes: start with customer‑benefiting use cases, build basic governance, and train the team.
- Measurement is non‑negotiable: define KPIs and review them regularly.
- Encourage small pilots, clear owners, and privacy practices so teams move fast safely.

## 🗣 Case study anecdote

A neighborhood clinic adopted AI to draft appointment reminders and summarize intake notes. With a simple QA checklist and staff training, the team cut paperwork time and focused more on patient care.

## 🛠 Guidance for SMBs

- Define the use case: Pick one workflow with clear value (content drafts, FAQ replies, or weekly reporting). Baseline cycle time, error rate, and customer response metrics.
- Governance basics: Document prompts, create a QA checklist, and assign owners. Store SOPs in a shared folder and keep versions.
- Risk management: Review data access and permissions. Avoid pasting sensitive information into tools not designed for it.
- Training: Host short “prompt practice” sessions to align tone and accuracy. Encourage peer reviews for the first month.
- Publish a simple KPI dashboard (time saved, first‑response, conversion) and review it weekly to decide what to scale next.

## 📈 Lessons & metrics

- Cycle‑time reduction should be noticeable within 2–4 weeks; track time saved per week.
- Quality metrics (reply accuracy, customer satisfaction) should improve as prompts mature.
- Use a simple scorecard (time, conversion, retention) to decide what to scale next.
- Assign owners and backups; document changes so improvements persist beyond individuals.
