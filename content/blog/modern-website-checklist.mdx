Your website is often the first impression potential customers have of your business. For SMBs, a professional, fast, and trustworthy website can be the difference between winning a customer and losing them to a competitor.

After auditing hundreds of SMB websites, we've identified the key elements that separate high-converting sites from those that drive customers away. Here's your comprehensive checklist to ensure your website builds trust and converts visitors into customers.

## Performance & Speed (Critical for SMBs)

**Why it matters:** 53% of users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. For SMBs, every lost visitor is a lost opportunity.

### ✅ Page Load Speed
