**TL;DR**

- Formal research into AI and labor/productivity dynamics.
- Useful for strategy and policy context around adoption impacts.
- SMBs can apply findings to role design, training, and measurement.

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Contributes to understanding the relationship between AI task coverage, productivity, and workforce dynamics.
- Suggests heterogeneity in impacts across roles and sectors; measurement and training matter.

## ðŸ—£ Case study anecdote

A specialty manufacturer cataloged repetitive documentation tasks and piloted AI for draft creation and compliance checks. With training and QA, documentation time fell and engineers focused more on design iterations.

## ðŸ›  Guidance for SMBs

- Pair pilots with role clarity: list tasks to assist and tasks to keep humanâ€‘led. Train against both.
- Measure over time: throughput, error rates, rework, and satisfaction (customer/staff).
- Update job descriptions and review prompts quarterly as workflows evolve.

## ðŸ“ˆ Lessons & metrics

- Assisted documentation/reporting reduces time and variance.
- Training and QA are essential to sustain quality.
